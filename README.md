A Visual Studio Code theme for those who love the forest. Fine-tuned for those of us who like to code in nature. Color choices have taken into consideration what is accessible to people with colorblindness and in low-light circumstances. Decisions were also based on meaningful contrast for reading comprehension and for optimal razzle dazzle. âœ¨

As of 1.0.0, there's a Verdant Dawn theme too! Color balanced from the Dark version for easy viewing in daylight. ðŸŒ…
